# PCB Basics

* Sparkfun's glossary: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pcb-basics

# Schematic

* Lots of good resources from sparkfun: 
* Arduino shield library is from Adafruit:
    * Eagle Version 5: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library/archive/6042b7efe7b0f2f9511c54ebdba88d8e4de44aa2.zip
    * Eagle Version 6: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library/archive/master.zip

# Board

* We'll be mostly following this guide from sparkfun: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-eagle-board-layout
* Use this CAM file from sparkfun: https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/assets/c/1/9/8/2/52056b19757b7f795b2a561c.zip
* Optionally use this DRU file from sparkfun: https://dlnmh9ip6v2uc.cloudfront.net/assets/1/e/3/2/0/52054e25757b7f44119e09da.zip
* Check your board with a web based 3d viewer: http://mayhewlabs.com/webGerber/
